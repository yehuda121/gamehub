# Yehuda Shmulevitz – Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The project was originally based on a small React playground and has been fully redesigned and refactored into a professional portfolio intended for presenting my work as a Software Engineer.

The website provides a structured, clear, and polished presentation of my background, selected projects, and technical capabilities. It is designed to support recruiters and engineering teams in evaluating my experience across software development, cloud technologies, AI-based features, and systems engineering.

## Overview

The portfolio includes a modern hero section with a professional summary, direct access to my CV, and links to external profiles. A curated list of featured projects highlights my work in full-stack development, backend logic, cloud-native architectures, machine learning, and systems programming. The design emphasizes usability, readability, and high-quality engineering presentation.

Multilingual support is built in using i18next, including full handling of both LTR and RTL layouts. The site is deployed on Firebase Hosting and optimized for fast loading and consistent behavior across devices.

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a clean project structure with clear separation of pages, components, styling, assets, and translation files. The design and implementation aim to maintain readability, scalability, and ease of extension.

Small tools and mini-apps from the original project are included as a separate section. These serve as an optional technical playground and may be expanded over time.
